# Blackjack Project

This is a simple implementation of the Blackjack card game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Overview

In this project, I have created a basic Blackjack game where a player aims to reach a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The Player is dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards and up their total. The objective is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21, and achieving a hand value of 21 with the first two cards results in a "Blackjack."

## Features

- The Player starts with a chip balance of $150.
- The game tracks the player's cards, total sum, and chip balance.
- A message is displayed indicating the game's status, such as "Do you want to draw a new card?" or "You're out of the game!"
- If a player achieves Blackjack, their chip balance increases by $25.
- The game restarts with a chip balance of $150 if the player runs out of chips.

## How to Play

1. Click the "START GAME" button to begin a new game.
2. The game will deal you two cards and display your current sum and cards.
3. The game will provide messages based on your choices and the outcome.
4. If you achieve Blackjack, you'll receive bonus chips!
5. Additional note: Please, try to give at least a 2 or 3 seconds break when pushing the action buttons.
