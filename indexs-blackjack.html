        <p>Blackjack is a card game where players aim to reach a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
            Players are dealt two cards and can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current
            total. Number cards retain their face value, face cards are worth 10, and Aces can be counted as 1 or 11. The
            objective is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21, and achieving a hand value of 21 with the first
            two cards results in a "Blackjack" and typically offers a higher payout.</p>
